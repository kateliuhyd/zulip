# Schedule a reminder

Zulip allows you to schedule a reminder for a message at a later time. The
reminder is delivered to you as a [direct message](/help/direct-messages) by
Notification Bot at the scheduled time. For example, you might schedule a
reminder for a message to reply to when you have more time, or one about a task
to take care of.

You can also [schedule a message](/help/schedule-a-message) to be sent to any
conversation at a later time.
