# Channel feed

The **Channel feed** is a feed of all the topics that you have not
[muted](/help/mute-a-topic) in a particular channel. It's a great way to get a
quick overview of recent messages in a channel.

## Go to channel feed for a subscribed channel

{start_tabs}

{tab|desktop-web}

{!channel-actions.md!}

1. Click **Go to channel feed**. If you do not see this option, Zulip is
   [configured](#configure-where-channel-links-in-the-left-sidebar-go) so that
   clicking on the channel name in the left sidebar will take you directly to
   the channel feed.

    You can also go to the channel feed from a conversation view or from the
    [list of topics in a channel](/help/list-of-topics), by tapping the
    **channel feed** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-all-messages mobile-help"></i>)
    icon in the upper right corner of the app.
