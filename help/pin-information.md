# Pin information

You can use [channel
descriptions](/help/view-channel-information#view-channel-description) to pin
reference information, such as:

- Related channels
- Important topics or messages
- Documentation and other external references

Channel descriptions appear in the navigation bar at the top of the web and
desktop apps when you view the channel. You can hover over long channel
descriptions with the mouse to view them in full.

You can also pin messages for yourself by [starring](/help/star-a-message) them.
