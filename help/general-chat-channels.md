# “*General chat*” channels

Zulip's [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics) help you keep conversations
organized, but you may not need topics in some channels (e.g., a social channel,
or one with a narrow purpose).

If you have permission to administer a channel, you can configure it to only
have the special “*general chat*” topic. The name of this topic is shown in
italics, and is translated into [your language](/help/change-your-language).

Users won't need to enter a topic when sending a message to a “*general chat*”
channel.
