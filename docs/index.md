# Zulip documentation overview

Welcome! This is the documentation site for running [Zulip organized team
chat](https://zulip.com) in production, contributing to the [Zulip open-source
project](https://github.com/zulip), and generally learning how Zulip works under
the hood.

The following pages may help you get started:

- [Installation instructions](production/install.md) for setting up your Zulip
  server.
- [Contributing guide](contributing/contributing.md), with step-by-step
  instructions on how to get started contributing code to Zulip.

You may also want to check out:

- [An overview](https://zulip.com/features/) of the features available in Zulip.
- [Help center documentation](https://zulip.com/help/) for users and
  administrators of Zulip organizations.
- [API documentation](https://zulip.com/api/) for writing integrations or bots
  using the Zulip API.
